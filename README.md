Raindrops_78
============
This is a program that makes raindrops.

I have created a catcher, and a raindrop class. 

Raindrops fall from the sky. 

The objective of the game is to catch raindrops. 

If it's caught the score increases. 

If it is caught, the raindrops go away. 

If you have missed 3 raindrops, then you lose the game. 

To reset the game after you have lost press R on your keyboard.

BUGS AND GLITCHES
============
The game over screen only flashes but does not end the game as it is flashing the game is still running.

Half of a raindrop is off the screen.
