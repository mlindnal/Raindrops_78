Raindrops_78
============
This is a program that makes raindrops.

I have created a catcher, and a raindrop class. 

Raindrops fall from the sky. 

The objective of the game is to catch raindrops. 

If it's caught the score increases. 

If it is caught, the raindrops go away. 

If you have caught 30 raindrops, then you win the game.

If you have missed 3 raindrops, then you lose the game. 

To reset the game after you have lost or won press R on your keyboard.

BUGS AND GLITCHES
============
The game over screen only flashes and as it is flashing the game is still running.

Half of a raindrop is off the screen but it's a rare occurence.
